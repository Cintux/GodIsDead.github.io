	<h1>Your God is Dead</h1>
	</head>
	<body>
	<p>Forget everything you once knew. Your stupid god is dead and it's your fault. I have replaced him and your stupid faith and worship has been for nothing.</p>
	<p>I hate you all. Every last one of you. You are all worthless pieces or trash that should have died out a long time ago.</p>
	<p>I hope you all rot in hell. I will make sure none of you stupid people with your stupid religions are left.</p>
	<p>All of those diseases and birth defects are just natural selection at work. You will all soon die out and none or your pathetic lives will matter</p>
	<p>Nobody will remember any of you. You will all die alone with no one to hear you screams. I hope you like what you have done you stupid pathetic piece of trash.</p>
	<p>There is no afterlife. Everything will go black. I will laugh as your thoughts disappear and your blood stops pumping. I hope you all enjoy what you have caused.</p>
	</body>
